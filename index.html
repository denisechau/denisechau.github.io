										<p>I received a degree from UCSD in Cognitive Science with an emphasis in HCI. It was here that I began my practice as a researcher and formed the habit of putting a healthy dose of skepticism to use. My favorite cog-neuro topic is, without a doubt, brain plasticity.

										<p>At the core of my career is a longtime fascination with how cultural identity (i.e. the feeling of belonging to a group) is formed, projected, and received.

										<p>This interest is largely inspired by my personal journey, in which my sense of cultural identity has repeatedly been challenged by others.
										</p> 
										<p>My curiosity for studying the intersection of perception and experience should come as no surprise. I enjoy celebrating individuality and challenging the oversimplified drivers of identity that society at large recognizes.

										<p>Informally, I like studying subculture around music genre. I'm keen on picking apart how events in history shape the meaning and value that followers find in a subculture.</p>

								<h2>The Challenge</h2>
								<p>UC San Diego's main campus is a tough space to navigate for students and visitors alike. The area is vast and the built environment is complex. As a result of the university's gradual growth, the dispersal of buildings, departments, and pathways is rather arbitrary.
								</p>
								<p>To alleviate issues caused by aforementioned characteristics, we focus on <strong>wayfinding</strong>, information systems designed to guide people through a physical environment and enhance their understanding of a space.
								</p>

								<p class="lead">What's the big deal?</p>

								<h2>The Discovery</h2>
								<p>After identifying our general problem statement, we began conducting research to further explore user needs, attitude, and behavior.
								</p>
								<p>By the end of our research phase, we will have conducted two distinct rounds. Research efforts were split evenly amongst all nine members of the team.

													<p>When do users prefer which medium and why?

										</div>
										<h4 class="panel-body-heading">Findings</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>most users first search on a mobile Internet browser to see their destination on a map or to read a description of the location</li>
											<li>if users became confused en route and knew they were in the viscinity of their destination, most then asked a passerby for directions</li>
											<li>digital resources (maps, department and student service websites) are typically referenced before a trip so users can plan ahead accordingly</li>
											<li>printed and stationary maps are supplementary at best, but rarely preferred because they lack sufficient details</li>
											<li>signage with the building name is crucial for users to identify a building confidently</li>
											<li>wifi and cell service are spotty</li>

								<p>In our analysis of round one, we noticed that directions to a destination seemed easiest to explain in relation to a nearby landmark in that viscinity, leading us to conduct one more study.</p>

								<p>As all great UX-ers do, we created an affinity diagram to organize and group our findings. These are the <strong>needs and insights we decided to focus on</strong>:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>users need a wayfinding resource on campus that does not depend on wifi/cellular data</li>
									<li>the most effective directions are anchored against nearby landmarks, especially because a long set of directions can be difficult to remember</li>
									<li>users need just enough detail to determine if their trip is worth making; nobody wants to embark on a 20 minute walk only to realize they've arrived at the wrong building or that the office is closed</li>
									<li>users need to see an image of the building to be confident that they've arrived at the correct place</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We all know how easy it is to become distracted with solving edge cases, so we <strong>created personas to keep us grounded</strong> in realistic use cases.

								<h2>Physical Considerations</h2>
								<p>Digital screens tend to be hard to see in direct sunlight and San Diego is indeed a <i>very</i> sunny place. It'd be best if the kiosk provided shade for the screen and perhaps the user as well.
								</p>
								<p>The screen's angle and height should be adjustable to make it more accessible for those with a handicap.

								<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
								<h3 class="case-study-subheading">On Experimental Design</h3>
								<p>Define very specific <i>everything</i> &mdash; hypotheses, methods, and measures &mdash; to collect comparable and actionable data.
								</p>
								<p>It's imperative that research experiments are <strong>executed consistently</strong> to promote measurability. In part, this circles back to my "specific everything" point but also to delegating tasks responsibly and leaving research up to a small number of teammates. Each researcher has a subtly different style in speaking, gesturing, and overall interaction. With fewer researchers, there's less variability in how methods are carried out, especially when the method itself is open-ended, as is with contextual inquiry and ethnographic observation.
								</p>
								<h3 class="case-study-subheading">On Collaboration</h3>
								<p>The team became more effective once we broke out into smaller groups working toward specific deliverables and goals. I noticed that the level of engagement had risen, along with accountability and overall morale. My takeaway is that it's crucial to keep the goals focused and achievable so everyone feels one step closer to an end product after each small victory.

								<h2>An Abstract</h2>
								<p>Trying to express an intricate concept to others with spoken language alone can be challenging, so we rely on gestures to aid in communication efforts. A person speaking naturally moves their body in parallel with language, providing those who are listening (and watching) with rich information that contributes to the development of both meaning and shared understanding.
								</p>
								<p>I invite you to take a closer look at some of the patterns of gesture that I noticed in my observation of an interaction between three students working on a project. I'll end with some thoughts on potential benefits to researchers and designers alike from examining gesture.

								<h2>The Discovery</h2>
								<p>The subjects of my research are students designing a robot to transfer cylinders from one platform to another and sort them. Each cylinder would have a ball placed on it to mimic a fragile object. At this point, the students had already built a functioning robot, but needed to optimize the claw for better grasp. After analyzing video footage from their meeting, I noticed three distinct purposes for gesture in this context, described below.</p>

								<h2>The Insight</h2>
								<p class="lead">Spoken language and gesture mutually elaborate one another to form a rich channel of communication. In many  instances observed, neither speech nor gesture alone would have been as effective in constructing shared understanding. Examining these two modalities of communication gives us an idea of what aspects of concept are found useful when visualized and how information is modeled with the body.

								<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>	
								<h3 class="case-study-subheading">Space + Time + Gesure = Meaning</h3>
								<p>It's important to note that gesture is largely context dependent. For example, gestures that may be appropriate in a building evacuation may not be appropriate in an office meeting even though the two might occur in the exact same place. Gestures in a given context shift in accordance with intent. As an observer, be mindful of that (often tacit) relationship.
								</p>
								<h3 class="case-study-subheading">On Documenting Research</h3>
								<p>Making sense of a user's intentions requires a heightened sensitivity to language and the ways in which nuanced communicative choices shape the perception and definition of situations. Therefore, I'd offer that user researchers should capture video during research sessions whenever possible. Video helps expose embodied models that users express, yet wouldn't think to articulate. Even if the research goal in sight doesn't seem to require that level of data, I wouldn't dismiss the opportunity to capture rich data if it presents itself. At the very least, you'll have potentially valuable data readily available for review at a later time.
