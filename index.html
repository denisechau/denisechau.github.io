								<p>In the initial stages after research for me, it's about throwing many things at the wall and seeing what sticks. I find that I have the tendency to pixel push when I wireframe digitally, so I started by sketching potential layouts and workflows on grid paper this time.

								<h3>Bringing Fidelity Up a Notch</h3>
								<p>After deciding on a workflow to move on with, I began prototyping in Sketch. In Sketch, my focus shifts to emphasize visual design. Now that I had an accurate sense for how things would look on a mobile screen, I started refining layout, use of color, imagery, and typography.</p>

									<div class="col-sm-7 col-lg-8">
										<span><strong>"My Schedule" vs "Favorites"</strong></span>
										<p>I decided to change the phrasing around "Favorites" to "My Schedule." The concept and use case remained the same. I was still providing users with the ability to compile one class schedule view from multiple studios. I just fancied the idea behind a schedule that was uniquely for that user, whereas "favorites" felt like a dated term reserved only for use in interfaces.</p>
										<p>Although this change in phrasing seemed to briefly confuse one participant, I decided to keep it as is for two reasons: 1) the user quickly caught on and 2) I was not shifting the model (favorite/unfavorite, save/unsave). Had I been shifting the model then I would have been introducing a larger learning curve, in which case I'd be more concerned with benchmarking metrics pre- and post-adjustment to compare.</p>

								<h3>On Post-Task Q&A</h3>
								<p>This project helped reaffirm how useful post-usability conversation can be. While this is an excellent time to clarify anything from the usability test itself, it's a great chance to build a rapport by asking open-ended questions to prompt informal, yet constructive conversation.
								</p>
								<p>As a researcher, conducting research and collecting actionable data is the obvious part of the job. The implicit part of the job is about building relationships with users, as you are oftentimes one of the few people that actually represent the team.</p>

								<h2 class="text-center">The Challenge</h2>
								<hr>
								<p>UC San Diego's main campus is a tough space to navigate. On average, we found that 9/10 individuals on campus have been lost at some point and 7/10 have been late to an obligation because they were lost.
								</p>
								<p>As a whole, the campus is vast, dense, and the overall structure is rather arbitrary. When you look closer at the parts, you'll find dozens of unnamed footpaths, lots of plaza-styled space, and curvy roadways/sidewalks.
								</p> 
								<p>
								To alleviate navigational issues caused by these characteristics, we focus on <strong>wayfinding</strong>, information systems designed to guide people through a physical environment and enhance their understanding of a space.

								<h3>Reflection</h3>
								<p>After re-evaluating the solution that the group came to at the close of the project, I had a few thoughts and critiques which led to my own redesign.</p>
								<p>Throughout our research phase, the moment that stuck out to me was the point at which users would grow tired of their digital resources and would seek verbal directions out of preference. Most of the value for users came through descriptive context and what proved particularly useful was anchoring the destination against smaller landmarks in its viscinity.</p>
								<h3>Redesign</h3>
								<p>A static wayfinding system that draws from the model that is naturally used to navigate campus (college > major landmark(s) > nearby destination). The signage offers context in a way that's similar to how verbal directions tend to be given, only it's more accessible and definitive.

								<h3>On Experimental Design</h3>
								<p>Define very specific <i>everything</i> &mdash; hypotheses, methods, and measures &mdash; to collect comparable and actionable data.
								</p>
								<p>It's imperative that research experiments are <strong>executed consistently</strong> to promote measurability. In part, this circles back to my "specific everything" point but also to delegating tasks responsibly and leaving research up to a small number of teammates. Each researcher has a subtly different style in speaking, gesturing, and overall interaction. With fewer researchers, there's less variability in how methods are carried out, especially when the method itself is open-ended, as is with contextual inquiry and ethnographic observation.
								</p>
								<h3>On Collaboration</h3>
								<p>The team became more effective once we broke out into smaller groups working toward specific deliverables and goals. I noticed that the level of engagement had risen, along with accountability and overall morale. My takeaway is that it's crucial to keep the goals focused and achievable so everyone feels one step closer to an end product after each small victory.
								</p>
								<!--
								<h3>On My Contribution</h3>
								<p>I conducted user research ...tbd
									We all built affinity and talked about results
									I built a paper prototype and tested with two users
									Meeting logistics, planning, communication (these are our goals, come ready to talk about this given topic, led a meeting or two)

								<h1>The Ecology of Meaning</h1>
								<h2>An Abstract</h2>
								<hr>
								<p>Trying to express an intricate concept to others with spoken language alone can be challenging, so we rely on gestures to aid in communication efforts. A person speaking naturally moves their body in parallel with language, providing those who are listening (and watching) with rich information that contributes to the development of both meaning and shared understanding.
								</p>
								<p>I invite you to take a closer look at some of the patterns of gesture that I noticed in my observation of an interaction between three students working on a project. I'll end with some thoughts on potential benefits to researchers and designers alike from examining gesture.

								<h2>The Discovery</h2>
								<hr>
								<p>The subjects of my research are students designing a robot to transfer cylinders from one platform to another and sort them. Each cylinder would have a ball placed on it to mimic a fragile object. At this point, the students had already built a functioning robot, but needed to optimize the claw for better grasp. After analyzing video footage from their meeting, I noticed three distinct purposes for gesture in this context, described below.</p>

								<h2>The Insight</h2>
								<hr>
								<p class="lead">Spoken language and gesture mutually elaborate one another to form a rich channel of communication. In many  instances observed, neither speech nor gesture alone would have been as effective in constructing shared understanding. Examining these two modalities of communication gives us an idea of what aspects of concept are found useful when visualized and how information is modeled with the body.

								<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
								<hr>	
								<h3>Space + Time + Gesure = Meaning</h3>
								<p>It's important to note that gesture is largely context dependent. For example, gestures that may be appropriate in a building evacuation may not be appropriate in an office meeting even though the two might occur in the exact same place. Gestures in a given context shift in accordance with intent. As an observer, be mindful of that (often tacit) relationship.
								</p>
								<h3>On Documenting Research</h3>
								<p>Making sense of a user's intentions requires a heightened sensitivity to language and the ways in which nuanced communicative choices shape the perception and definition of situations. Therefore, I'd offer that user researchers should capture video during research sessions whenever possible. Video helps expose embodied models that users express, yet wouldn't think to articulate. Even if the research goal in sight doesn't seem to require that level of data, I wouldn't dismiss the opportunity to capture rich data if it presents itself. At the very least, you'll have potentially valuable data readily available for review at a later time.
